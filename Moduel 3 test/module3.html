          <h2>Chicken</h2>
              The chicken is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.The chicken is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.Chicken is a bird, belonging to the family Phasianidae, scientifically called Gallus gallus, and is a domesticated subspecies of the wild red junglefowl. Domesticated animals or in this case birds share a sustained multi-generational relationship and are dependent on reproduction, care, and supply of resources from the previous generations. As of 2018, Chickens are estimated to be the most common and widespread domestic animals with a population of 23.7 billion. The number has risen significantly for up more than 19 billion since 2011.  Its ancient genetic maternal origins are in India and then moved across the world.Chicken is known to be a descendant in Southeast Asia of the Indian red junglefowl, and it is an ancestor of the popular domesticated chicken. It backs to at least 2000 BC when domestication first began, and these are called Gallus domesticus. They were first used for the sport of cockfighting. Then gradually they were bred for the purpose of meat production and eggs. There are about 350 different combinations of Chicken breeds today. All existing in different colours, shapes, and sizes. American Poultry Association in 1873, for organizing and establishing excellence in standards of breeding and classification of breeds. The birds raised in America today are mostly for meat production and the popularly bred ones are Cornish, a British Breed, and White Rock, a breed that was first developed in New England.he scientific names are included in the Binomial Nomenclature of officially naming the animals according to their Kingdom, genus, and species. Chicken belongs to the Animalia kingdom. The genus is the first name that is the family of the animal it belongs to and species is the specific family the genus belongs to and that is the second name. The species also is further classified as subspecies for differentiating domesticated ones from the wild.The scientific name of hen is the same as the chicken scientific name which is Gallus gallus domesticus. Female chickens become Hen when they start laying eggs and since their family and genus or species don’t change the names too remain unchanged.A male chicken is called a rooster and a female one is referred to as a hen. Young ones are called chicks. Castrated ones are referred to as capons or neutered roosters. Both are generally called chickens. Less than 1-year-old chickens are called cockerels and females within their first year are called pullets.After their 1st-year cockerels become cocks and pullets since they start laying eggs become hens. There are varying breeds of chickens and chicken weights also vary according to their specific breed. On average they weigh 1.8 kg to 4.5 kg. The weight varies based on whether they are roosters (males) or hens (females). There are some breeds like Jersey Giant Chicken where the rooster hen weighs 4.5 kg and roosters weigh 5.9 kg. The other breeds that fall on the higher end of the weighing scale are Brahma chickens, Cochin chickens, and Orpington chickens. And the other breeds like Bantam Chicken are much more on the lighter side. Chickens nowadays exhibit limited growth and development. They do not grow in likeness to their full potential because they are slaughtered beforehand. And since now they are only heavily bred for meat and prematurely slaughtered they are small and underdeveloped and underweight. The most common confusion is the difference between hen and chicken. And it is quite a simple one to understand, basically when a female chicken reaches a stage when they lay eggs while it is arguable because some disagree saying that the transition starts after a year and they are no longer pullets. However, now the bred ones start laying eggs after 16-20 weeks itself. Summer and spring seasons are considered optimal for breeding and egg-laying naturally occur in the daylight. Nowadays this process is also triggered by artificial light in the nighttime.The unique parts of the chicken are cloaca and chicken feet. The chickens have a very efficient digestive system distinct from humans; they have no teeth but a beak that breaks food into smaller digestible pieces. The stomach is where the actual digestion starts. The cloaca is an orifice or a cavity that is present in the posterior region at the end of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive tract. It serves as the only opening and changes depending on bodily functions. The cloaca seals the oviduct when the chicken defecates, and the end of the digestive tract is sealed at the time of laying eggs.Chicken feets have a hock that is like the ankle which connects to the shank that is to the thighs of the chicken. And thus the foot is nothing but a part of the ankle bones. And this part often bends when they walk so they walk on their toes all the time.The skin of Chicken also varies, as the body has a feathered skin-like appearance whereas the legs and feet appear to be scaled skin. And the footpad is unique because it’s tough, thick, and more flexible than other areas of the body. The toenails and beak of the chicken are made of hard keratin each serving a special function.
